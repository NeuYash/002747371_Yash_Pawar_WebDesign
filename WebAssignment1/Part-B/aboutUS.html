                <h2>About us</h2>
                Born in <u>BOSTON </u>With the intention of providing outstanding,
                 wholesome food at reasonable prices, Robert Huntington founded the
                  restaurant in BOSTON in 1997 at <wbr>MA-02116<wbr>. Although we
                   wouldn't be so blunt as to instruct you on how to eat your bread,
                    adding extra sauces, cream, sugar, caramelized onions, and eggs
                     to the mixture is one of our best creations to yet. Our Bakery
                     is the best in boston which serves over 70 products and 1000 breads
                     daily. We follow clean practices to make our place as environment
                     friendly as possible. We have received boston bakers award for last 5
                     years.

           <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
            Everything we are doing is based on respect. Our goal is to bring people together by sharing a shared love of comfort food in order to foster a 
            culture of belonging. It represents how we handle clients, provide support, acquire our products, and pledge to act morally. In the greater <wbr>City Of Boston<wbr> we have run a lot of eateries. 
            We've always wanted to open a fusion restaurant serving Indian and American food.
            Everything we are doing is based on respect.
