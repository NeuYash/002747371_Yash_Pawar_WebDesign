## Website description

### Home

This page of my webiste is the homepage. There are a few quotes and images for better look. I have added navbar where we can see all the items like Home, About, and Contact. Some SASS components which can be highlighted are:

- Variables - Variables can be seen in the style.css file where root color is declared.
- Custom Properties - Custom background color called as --first-color
- Nesting - In scss file, nesting is not for every section of the page.
- Interpolation - @extend property in buttons file where it extends the main btn properties.
- Placeholder Selectors - again this is used in the button section. Placeholder selectors are useful when writing a Sass library where each style rule may or may not be used
- Mixins - Used mixins for grid style and title text for the homepage
- Functions - There is a function which changes the color of the background basd on the percentage of intensity of the color.

### About me

This section covers information about what this webite does. It also highlights the motto of the brand and achievements quantified on this page. The footer is consistent for all the pages where we can quickly access few links and social media icons. Even the navigation bar is the same for all the pages.
